\begin{lstlisting}
for x in range(0,n):
	print(x)
	print(x**2)
\end{lstlisting}
Note here that the complexity is $2n$
\begin{lstlisting}
for x in range(0,n):
	if x%2==0:
		print(x)
		print(x**2)
\end{lstlisting}
In the best case all numbers are odd numbers, therefore the complexity will be $n$ only will be executed the $if$ statement. The worst case when list a full of even numbers the complexity will be $3n$, and the average  will be then $2n$.
